# String-implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a simplified version of the C++ std::string class. The String class provides basic functionality to manipulate strings, such as concatenation, insertion, deletion, and retrieval of characters.

Implementation Details
The String class is implemented using dynamic memory allocation, with a character array used to store the actual string data. The class provides a range of constructors, including a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, a copy constructor, and a move constructor. The class also provides overloaded operators for assignment, concatenation, and comparison of strings.

In addition to the constructors and operators, the String class provides a variety of member functions to manipulate strings, including functions to retrieve and set the size and capacity of the string, push and pop characters onto and off of the string, insert and erase characters at specified positions, check if the string is empty, clear the contents of the string, and find the index of a specified character.
