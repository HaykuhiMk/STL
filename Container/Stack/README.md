# Stack Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of a Stack data structure in C++ using templates and the Standard Template Library (STL). 
The Stack is a container that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first 
one to be removed.
## Introduction
This C++ Stack implementation provides a generic, resizable, and efficient container for storing elements of any data type. 
It utilizes templates to allow the creation of stacks with different data types, making it highly versatile and reusable.
## Features
Support for any data type using C++ templates.


Efficient push and pop operations with constant time complexity (O(1)).


Size management with dynamic resizing of the underlying array.


Overloaded operators for comparison and assignment.


Ability to check if the stack is empty and retrieve its size.


Exception handling for accessing elements in an empty stack.


A utility function to print the elements of the stack.
