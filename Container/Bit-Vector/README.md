# Bit Vector
This repository contains an implementation of a Bit Vector data structure in C++.

## Overview
A Bit Vector, also known as a Bitset or Bit Array, is a data structure that efficiently represents an array of bits or Boolean values. It is commonly used for compact storage and manipulation of binary data.

## Features
Creation of a Bit Vector with a specified size
Setting and clearing individual bits
Getting the value of a specific bit
Performing bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
Counting the number of set bits (population count)
Checking for empty or full Bit Vectors
String representation of the Bit Vector
